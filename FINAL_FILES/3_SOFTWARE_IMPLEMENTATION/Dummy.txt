• Tasks you performed on MATLAB.
• Highlight any optimizations you performed on given code.

• Fixed point design approach:
	• Bit widths allocated for integer and fraction part.
	• Total memory needed for weights and biases (in bits).
	• Size of multiplier needed (Ex: 8 bit x 8 bit) 
	• Scripting to get HW compatible data.


• NOTE: Do not add any accuracy results here, there is a section for that 
later.
