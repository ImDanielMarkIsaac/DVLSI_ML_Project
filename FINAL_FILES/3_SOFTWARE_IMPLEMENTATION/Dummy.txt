• Fixed point design approach:
	• Bit widths allocated for integer and fraction part:
		w12: Total bit width = 11 , Bit width for integer part = 3, Bit width for fractional part = 8
		w23: Total bit width = 19 , Bit width for integer part = 3, Bit width for fractional part = 16
		b12: Total bit width = 11 , Bit width for integer part = 3, Bit width for fractional part = 8
		b23: Total bit width = 41 , Bit width for integer part = 9, Bit width for fractional part = 32

	• Total memory needed for weights and biases (in bits).
		Number of weights in w12 = 30 x 256 = 7680 weights
		Number of bits required to store w12 = 7680 x 11 = 84,480 bits
		
		Number of weights in w23 = 10 x 30 = 300 weights
		Number of bits required to store w23 = 300 x 19 = 5,700 bits

		Number of biases in b12 = 30 x 1 = 30 biases
		Number of bits required to store b12 = 30 x 11 = 330 bits

		Number of biases in b23 = 10 x 1 = 10 biases
		Number of bits required to store b23 = 10 x 41 = 410 bits

		Total memory needed = 84,480 + 5,700 + 330 + 410 = 90,920 bits

	• Size of multiplier needed (Ex: 8 bit x 8 bit)
		First stage multiplier = 11 bit x 1 bit
		ReLU_1 stage multiplier = 11 bit x 11 bit
		Second stage multiplier = 19 bit x 22 bit 
		ReLU_2 stage multiplier = 41 bit x 41 bit

	• Scripting to get HW compatible data.


• NOTE: Do not add any accuracy results here, there is a section for that 
later.
